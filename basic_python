1. Create an assert statement that throws an AssertionError if the variable spam is a negative
integer.
Ans:-
Here is assert statement which will through a error when user given a negative input
assert spam >= 0 , "this is negative integer"

2. Write an assert statement that triggers an AssertionError if the variables eggs and bacon contain

considered the same, and &#39;goodbye&#39; and &#39;GOODbye&#39; are also considered the same).
Ans:-
Here are example the through assertationerror:-
x=1
y=0
assert y!=0,"this is invalid opration"

3. Create an assert statement that throws an AssertionError every time.
Ans:-
Here is statement below that always through assertationerror:-

assert False,"this is invalid"

4. What are the two lines that must be present in your software in order to call logging.debug()?
